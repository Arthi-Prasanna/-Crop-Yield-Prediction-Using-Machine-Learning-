This project, Crop Yield Prediction Using Machine Learning, aims to accurately forecast agricultural crop yields by analyzing key environmental, climatic, and agricultural factors such as rainfall, temperature, pesticide usage, crop type, and regional information. Using Python-based data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and a Decision Tree Regressor model, the system cleans and transforms raw data, identifies important patterns, and generates reliable yield predictions supported by performance metrics like MAE and R². The project includes a complete workflow from data acquisition to model training, evaluation, and deployment using a Flask API, with optional Docker containerization and a simple frontend for user interaction. By providing data-driven insights, this system supports farmers, researchers, and policymakers in improving resource optimization, reducing risks caused by climate variability, and enhancing sustainable agricultural planning.
